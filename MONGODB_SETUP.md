# MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide for GStep

## üîß Current Configuration

Your MongoDB URI has been configured in the `.env` file:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://aarthi:aarthi@cluster0.kcaxvpi.mongodb.net/gstep
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IP Whitelist Issue Resolution

The current connection issue is due to IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Add Your IP to Atlas Whitelist
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Login with your credentials
3. Select your cluster (Cluster0)
4. Go to "Network Access" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Add IP Address"
6. Choose "Add Current IP Address" or "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)
7. Save the changes

### Option 2: Allow All IPs (For Development)
Add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow access from any IP address (use only for development)
